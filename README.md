# Hello there! :wave:

I'm Joan, a 4th-year Computer Science student at the Barcelona School of Informatics (FIB), specializing in Computing. I am passionate about Generative AI and Computer Vision. On my profile, you'll find a selection of assignments submitted for classes as well as some of my personal projects.

I am currently working as a Generative AI Developer at The CX Lab Barcelona. In 2023, I participated in a Summer Program at the Beijing Institute of Technology, where I deepened my understanding of AI. 

Following this, my academic pursuits continued at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm as an exchange student. Here, I am focusing on my bachelor's thesis on AI in Credit Scoring while also expanding my knowledge through Master's courses in Machine Learning.

Here are some stats about my profile:
